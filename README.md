# TravelingSalesmanProblem

JDK Version 18

Frontend - Java Swing

Alogrithms implemented - 
1) Christofides Algorithm
2) 2-opt Optimization
3) 3-opt Optimization
4) Simulated Annealling
5) Ant Colony

Aim - The goal of this paper is to examine the Christofides algorithm's effectiveness and 
that of its optimization techniques, including tactical techniques like 2-opt and 3-opt 
improvement and strategic techniques like simulated annealing and ant colony 
optimization. We can find excellent approximations to the traveling salesman issue 
using these techniques. This study will also examine the drawbacks and difficulties 
of these approaches and offer suggestions for further investigation.


*** Steps for running the code ***
Execute the main method in the TSPSolution src folder to run the project. 

Note - While running the different algorithms on the UI, the graph takes time to load util the code has been executed 
in the backend. As a result, the buttons will freeze.
